# Questions/Notes:
- Is an outdent more important than rubrication? At urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.48 on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:15v, there is an outdent, but the Î· is black. This is a spot where Willcock has a paragraph break. For now (1/1/18), I have considered it part of a larger paragraph because every other place I would consider the outdent a paragraph it is red.
- I encountered a similar occurence at urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.484 on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:21r:, but have    declined call it a paragraph break due to the lack of rubrication. It is marked in my list above (Outdents without Rubrication) (1/10/18)
- There is a whole page of commentary (urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:21v) before the beginning of the Catalogue of Ships on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:22r
- There could be a paragraph break at urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.759 on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:25r as that line ends the Catalogue of Ships, but while urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:2.760 begins an outdent there is no rubrication and the combination of outdenting and rubrication has been my rule for determining paragraph separation. (1/10/18)
-Some, but not all of the outdents without rubrication occur at places where Willock has paragraph separation. It might be helpful later on to develop a model where these are treated as subsets in a paragraph or some sort of view that examines the relationship between the rubricated and non-rubricated outdents. (1/10/18)
- urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:3.276 on line urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1.30v the hand is similar to the paragraph hand, a large and thicker letter, but it lacks rubrication, so for now it will go in the Outdents without Rubrication list. It begins a speech. (1/10/18)
- The capital of line urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.e4:3.437 on urn:cite2:hmt:e4.v1:32v is in a similar hand to the other paragraph capitals, but it is black. For now, I have ruled it an outdent without rubrication. It begins a speech. (1/11/18)
